            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>Flourish & Free was born from my passion for baking and the need to adapt recipes to fit my dietary restrictions. As someone who loves creating delicious treats but faces gluten and dairy sensitivities, I’ve spent years experimenting to make my favorite recipes accessible without sacrificing flavor. This website is a space to share those creations with others who need or choose to avoid gluten and dairy, offering easy-to-follow recipes along with helpful tips on ingredient substitutions. It’s a place where everyone can bake freely, enjoy the process, and find new ways to indulge in their favorite sweets!</p>

        <p>Hi, I’m Sophia — a creative soul with a deep love for baking, art, and crafting things that bring comfort and joy. My journey in the kitchen has been shaped not just by curiosity and creativity, but also by necessity. I live with multiple medical conditions, including severe IBS and a long list of food allergies and intolerances — gluten, dairy (yes, even lactose-free), tomatoes, onion, garlic, quinoa, yeast, and more. Baking became a way for me to reclaim joy in food, explore safe alternatives, and prove that delicious treats can exist without the usual ingredients. My background in visual art and design brings a bit of flair to everything I make, and I’m always looking for ways to turn limitations into inspiration. Welcome to my little corner of the kitchen — I’m so glad you’re here!</p>
